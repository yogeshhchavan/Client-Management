Client Management Application Documentation

Introduction
The Client Management Application is designed to streamline the management of multiple clients, projects, and schedules, specifically catering to Anna’s architectural firm. This web application will allow Anna and her team to efficiently track client information, monitor project progress, manage client meetings, and store portfolio details, all in one place. The software solution will be developed by Henna Solutions using Agile methodology, enabling Anna’s firm to stay organized, save time, and enhance client satisfaction.


Objectives
1.	Efficient Client Management: Store and manage comprehensive client information, including contact details, project history, and portfolios.
2.	Project Task Tracking: Track tasks for various projects being developed in parallel, ensuring timely updates on project status.
3.	Meeting Scheduling: Schedule and manage meetings with clients, with alerts and reminders.
4.	User-Friendly Interface: Implement a front-end that is easy to navigate, with real-time data updates.
5.	Version Control Integration: Use GitHub to track changes and manage the distributed version control system, allowing for easy collaboration and versioning.


Prerequisites
The following tools and technologies are required to complete this project:
1.	Agile: Knowledge of Agile methodology and principles to manage the project tasks.
2.	Jira Software: For task management, sprint planning, and Agile process management.
